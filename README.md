# angular-quickstarter-gulp
The official quick starter angular2 rc.1 from angular repository ([Link](https://github.com/angular/quickstart)) "forked" with gulp typescript compiler and web server.

This is a very basic configuration using Gulp Task manager instead of live-server and tsc compiler. However, package.json remains all the run scripts for testing, live-server and tsc.

Use command gulp to run gulp-typescript gulp-sourcemaps gulp-webserver in watch mode.
