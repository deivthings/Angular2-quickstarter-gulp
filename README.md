# angular-quickstarter-gulp
The official quick starter angular2 rc.1 from angular repository ([angular/quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart)) "forked" with gulp typescript compiler and web server.

This is a very basic configuration using Gulp Task manager instead of live-server and tsc compiler, ready to add your custom gulp config. However, package.json remains all the run scripts for testing, live-server and tsc.

Use command gulp to run in watch mode:
* gulp-typescript
* gulp-sourcemaps
* gulp-webserver
